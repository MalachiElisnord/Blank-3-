## Objective
The project involved setting up an Active Directory environment, integrating it with Splunk for SIEM capabilities, and detecting brute force attacks using various hacking tools. The goal was to simulate real-world cybersecurity scenarios and monitor suspicious activities within the network.

### Skills Learned
- Active Directory configuration and management.
- SIEM integration and analysis with Splunk.
- Attack detection and investigation.
- Log analysis and event monitoring.
- Cyber threat hunting using the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

### Tools Used
- **Windows Server 2022**: Domain controller and Active Directory management.
- **Windows 10**: Client machine joined to the domain.
- **Kali Linux**: Offensive machine for testing attacks.
- **Splunk**: SIEM tool used for monitoring and logging activities.
- **Crowbar**: Brute-force attack tool.
- **Atomic Red Team**: For simulating adversary techniques.
- **Sysmon**: For monitoring system activities and logging.
- **MITRE ATT&CK Framework**: Used for identifying and categorizing attack techniques.

## Steps

### Step 1: Active Directory Setup
Configured Active Directory Domain Services (ADDS) on a Windows Server 2022 machine. Created organizational units, users, and groups for domain management.

### Step 2: Windows 10 Domain Join
Installed and configured Windows 10, then joined it to the Active Directory domain created on Windows Server.

### Step 3: Sysmon and Splunk Setup
Installed Sysmon on Windows machines for logging system activities. Configured Splunk to index and monitor logs from the Windows machine, specifically targeting logs generated by Sysmon.

### Step 4: Attack Simulation with Crowbar
Installed Crowbar on Kali Linux to perform a brute force attack on the Windows machines using RDP. Captured both failed and successful login attempts in Splunk.

### Step 5: Attack Detection in Splunk
Analyzed Splunk logs to detect the brute force attack attempts. Correlated the activity with the MITRE ATT&CK framework technique **T1204**.

### Step 6: Adversary Simulation with Atomic Red Team
Used Atomic Red Team to simulate additional attack techniques on the Windows machine. Captured the generated logs in Splunk and identified them using the MITRE framework.

## Conclusion
This project provided hands-on experience in configuring Active Directory, integrating with a SIEM tool (Splunk), and detecting real-world attack simulations. By monitoring and analyzing logs in Splunk, I was able to detect brute-force attacks and map them back to MITRE ATT&CK techniques for further investigation.
